							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<p><em>Global Language Academy (GLA)</em> is a language school in the Philippines that offers an engaging English as a Second Language (ESL) experience. Our educational institution provides ESL instruction in two campuses: Meridian International (MINT) College, which is home to the Professional English Program; and Enchanted Farm, for the General English Program.</p>
							<p>Our ESL programs hone beginners into well-rounded English speakers who can confidently communicate in any given setting and situation. By the end of our programs, they will be prepared to take their places in the global community.</p>
							<p>Studying at GLA also allows students to enjoy the Philippines’ terrific weather conditions year-round. Manila’s tropical climate is perfect for outdoor activities such as golf, tennis, swimming, horseback riding, hiking, and more. World-renowned beach resorts are also just a short drive away from the GLA campuses.</p>
